This date is not finalized yet so don't advertise anything until we hear more. This will _not_ be the big formal dinner thing that the MBA puts on every year (apparently often called \"MBA prom\"... I think Gail Miller came and spoke at it last year... _that_ event has yet to be scheduled).\n\n<@U05AN3RPDFU> and I have just found out that we have a slot to perform 2 songs with the choir. Should be pretty easy! (Since we know everyone is busy!) Apparently we won't have time in the program for any smaller musical numbers, so for those of you who were interested in doing a number by yourself, save it for a later day I guess!\n\nWe'll be nailing down a rehearsal schedule soon, which I suspect is what most people need to know about before they commit... stay tuned and we'll let you know!",
