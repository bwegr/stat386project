Please read the whole post!\n\nThe address is 362 W 370 S American Fork UT 84003. 20-25min from school depending on traffic.\n\nAvailable as early as 10\/20\/2023.\n\nThe home is having new carpet put in it. Move in date can also be negotiated. But the sooner the better.\n\nThe landlord would be the same as our landlord. His name is Gary Hogland and is honestly THE nicest guy. You treat his homes nice and he treats you with the same respect.\n3 bed\/2.5 bath with a 2 car garage. It's about 2000 sq ft. Open layout with an unfenced yard and couple garden boxes in the back. No Washer\/Dryer currently, but Gary is willing to work that out if needed.\n\nNo pets.\n\nRent is negotiable, Gary discounts it for MBA students and he 100% prefers them. He did mention it would be less than $2,000 a month but you'll need to contact him for the final cost.\n\nGas+electric could be anywhere between $200-250 a month. I'm guessing this because that's what we pay next door for roughly the same size home. Gary covers water\/garbage\/sewer costs in the rent price. Gary is also willing to work with you if you end up taking an internship out of the state. We decided to sign until the end of the whole MBA program in our lease next door.\n\nThe neighborhood and ward is STELLAR and quiet. Seriously. Lots of kids (and I mean LOTS) but the road is quiet and the most noise we hear is when we open the windows at night and you can hear the Highway nearby. Elementary school is great! We have a 1st grader and he loves his school. There are enough kids that they actually have 2 school busses for our neighborhood.\n\nLet us know if you any questions, or feel free to reach out to Gary. His number is <tel:801-836-4485|801-836-4485>",
