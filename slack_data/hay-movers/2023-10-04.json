It’s about 1 hour 15 mins away from Provo. \n\nMy mom would like to feed everyone dinner but I also know I don’t want to monopolize your precious Saturday…  :joy: so we’ll work something out, but there will be food after! \n\nOnce again thank you! May God bless all you wonderful, kind people!! \n:heart: :heart: :heart: ",
