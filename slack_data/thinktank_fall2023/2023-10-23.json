Also, there are several individuals who don't have their own business ideas but want to be a part of the exciting creation and discovery phases of an early business and they will be a part of the group.\n\nPlease reach out if you have any questions before the first meeting next Friday. Also, everyone is invited, this isn't exclusive. Looking forward to seeing you all next week!",
